# Podverse Sandbox

This is a repo for demos, bug reproductions for 3rd party open source libraries, and other miscellany.

Each demo can be found on its own branch.

Branches are named using the following pattern:

`<reponame>/<issue>-#`

The demo code will be found in folder named `demo`.

See README.md inside the `demo` folder for instructions on running the app.
